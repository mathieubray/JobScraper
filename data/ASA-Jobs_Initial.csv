								Internal Number: 18-197 NanoString Technologies (NASDAQ: NSTG) is a publicly held provider of life science tools for translational research and molecular diagnostics. The company's technology enables a wide variety of basic research, translational medicine and in vitro diagnostics applications.


NanoString's products are based on a novel digital molecular barcoding technology invented at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) in Seattle under direction of Dr. Leroy Hood. The company was founded in 2003 with an exclusive license to develop and market the technology. In 2008, NanoString launched its first commercial instrument system and began international sales operations with its first multiplexed assays for gene expression analysis. In 2010, the company launched new applications for the system to support microRNA analysis and copy number variation detection, and in 2013 launched Prosigna®, its first in vitro diagnostic product for prognosis of early stage breast cancer. 


Organizations performing cancer research, biomarker validation and screening, and next-generation sequencing validation are rapidly adopting the nCounter® Analysis System. By providing simple, multiplexed digital profiling of ...single molecules, the NanoString platform represents a natural, digital downstream companion to next-generation sequencing and enables researchers to embark on studies that were previously inconceivable.

Leading researchers and institutions are finding that NanoString's nCounter system provides the ideal platform on which to validate their discoveries and translate them into clinically useful diagnostic assays. The nCounter system is uniquely positioned to support translational research because it provides more reproducible results than methods requiring amplification, and generates high-quality data from the difficult sample types common in clinical research, including Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissues.

In addition to continuing to extend the applications for the nCounter system in the discovery, target validation and routine testing segments of the genomics research market, the company's goal is to become the platform of choice for diagnostic testing based on multiplexed gene signatures that can be offered in hospitals and pathology laboratories worldwide, following appropriate regulatory approvals. These two synergistic areas of business focus provide researchers with a seamless transition from discovery to diagnostics.

Just-in-time adaptive interventions often use mobile technologies to facilitate the delivery of individually-tailored interventions in near real-time. In health applications, this is an area of research that belongs to the domain of “precision medicine”. The scholar/scientist would join SRC’s Quantitative Methodology Program (QMP), a multidisciplinary team with expertise in statistics, psychology, information science, and computer science and would be part of the Data Science for Dynamic Intervention Decision-making Lab (d3lab) within QMP.  d3lab (see http://d3lab-isr.com/) is dedicated to improving health and education outcomes by developing, demystifying and disseminating data science tools for making better sequential (dynamic) intervention decisions. A key focus of the lab is the advancement and development of the science of adaptive interventions using novel randomized trial designs. We seek scholars with a strong statistical and methodological background who are interested in (i) the development of methods for adaptive interventions or just-in-time adaptive interventions, and (ii) the application of these methods in bio-behavioral health. This includes those with methodological expertise and interest in one or more of the following areas: Randomized trial methodology for optimizing or evaluating adaptive interventions, such as with sequential multiple-assignment randomized trials (SMART); Randomized trial methodology for optimizing just-in-time adaptive interventions, such as with micro-randomized trials (MRT); Methods for analyzing intensive longitudinal data arising from mobile health, such as feature construction methodology in high-dimensional settings, time-series analysis with latent variables, time-varying effect models, functional hierarchical linear modeling, and dynamic mediation analysis; Methods for the design and analysis of N-of-1 studies or single case designs; or Causal inference methodology for time-varying treatments/exposures.  SRC is a unique, world-renowned social and behavioral science research center that conducts investigator-initiated research on theoretical and applied problems of both social and scientific importance. Please see our website:  http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/.  A joint appointment with another department, institute, or school may be possible if desired.
